# Auto-Update Workflow Test

This document demonstrates the automated workflow functionality.

## How it Works

When code changes are pushed to the main branch, the workflow:

1. **Analyzes Changes**: Examines which files were modified
2. **Determines Version Increment**: 
   - Patch increment for minor changes
   - Minor increment for significant changes (index.html, package.json)
3. **Updates Package.json**: Increments version and README update count
4. **Updates README.md**: Refreshes version info, date, and change summary
5. **Commits Changes**: Automatically commits and pushes the updates

## Version History Tracking

The workflow maintains a detailed changelog in the README.md file, automatically adding entries for significant updates.

## Testing

To test the workflow:
1. Make any change to a code file
2. Commit and push to main branch
3. Watch the workflow run and automatically update the README and version
